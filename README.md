# Transaction_Fraud_Detection

The project aims to build a transaction fraud detection model with the dataset Card Transaction Data. For the project, data cleaning and imputation are conducted. Then, feature engineering is conducted to build the feature pool for feature selection. Different forward and backward selection models are tried, and the KS score for each feature is computed for the best forward selection model for feature selection. After selecting the best features, multiple machine learning and deep learning models are tried, including Logistic Regression, Boost Tree, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network. After tuning the hyperparameters, the performance of the models is evaluated to choose the final model to be deployed. The final model is chosen as a random forest with top 25 features, n_estimator=100, criterion=gini, max_depth=15, min_samples_leaf=200, and max_deatures=log2. The model could achieve a Training accuracy of 0.759, a Testing accuracy rate of 0.726, and a OOT of 0.531. The model can capture 53.1% of all the fraud with FDR at 3%. According to the financial curve, we recommend a score cutoff at 3%, where a maximum overall savings is achieved and is equal to 19,332,000.
