# Transaction_Fraud_Detection

The project aims to build a transaction fraud detection model with the dataset Card Transaction Data. For the project, data cleaning and imputation are conducted. Then, feature engineering is conducted to build the feature pool for feature selection. After selecting the best features, multiple machine learning and deep learning models are tried, including Logistic Regression, Boost Tree, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network. After tuning the hyperparameters, the performance of the models is evaluated to choose the final model to be deployed. The final model can achieve a training accuracy of 0.759, a testing accuracy rate of 0.726 and an oot accuracy rate of 0.531. In the end, the score cutoff point is recommended to achieve maximum overall savings.
